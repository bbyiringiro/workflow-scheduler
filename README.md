# Workflow Scheduler

## Overview

This project implements a workflow scheduler using a queue system with support for multiple queue backends (RabbitMQ and Bull). The scheduler can execute various actions in a predefined sequence, such as sending emails and waiting for a specified duration. It is designed to be extensible and easy to configure.

## Features

- **Extensible Workflow**: Easily define workflows by chaining actions like email sending and timers.
- **Queue Management**: Supports RabbitMQ and Bull for handling message queues.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatically retries failed actions based on configurable parameters.

## Architecture

The core components of the architecture include:

- **Actions**: Actions represent individual tasks within a workflow, such as sending an email (`EmailAction`) or waiting for a specified duration (`TimerAction`).
- **Workflows**: A `Workflow` consists of a sequence of actions to be executed in order.
- **Queues**: `RabbitMQQueue` and `BullQueue` are implemented to manage message processing and retry logic.
- **Event Handling**: The `EventHandler` service listens for incoming events, triggers the corresponding workflow, and enqueues the workflow for processing.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
-  **Node.js**: Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **pnpm**: This project uses `pnpm` for package management. You can install it globally using:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

	•	Docker: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed if you plan to run the application using Docker.
### Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/workflow-scheduler.git
cd workflow-scheduler
pnpm install
```

### Running the Application
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## Project Structure
